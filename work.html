                    <p>The key to success was mastering the art of stealth and timing. Sneak through rooms, knock over carefully stacked objects without alerting the shopkeepers, and vanish into the shadows before anyone could get a good look at you. Challenges awaited at every turn, from navigating narrow alleys without being seen to outsmarting the craftiest of pursuers.</p>
